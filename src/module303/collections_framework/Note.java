    /*
    List: an ordered collection of elements, which may contain duplicates. It is an interface that extends the Collection interface.
    Set: a Set contains NO duplicate elements:
        SortedSet extends set and adds the requirement that elements are ordered.
        NavigableSet extends set and adds operations for fuzzy comparisons.

    Queue: Queue is designed to hold elements for future processing:
        Queues are first in first out (FIFO)
        Some Java queues are last in first out (LIFO), although these are more properly called Stacks.
        Deque is a double-ended queue that supports insertion/removal at both ends


    Linked List is a data structure with nodes chained together via links.
    "next" "prev"
    doubly-linked list
    LinkedLists are optimized for insertion/removal
    accessing elements by index is O(N)
    inserting/removing the head or tail element is O(1) - ideal for implementing Stack and Queue.

    Set is a Collection with No duplicate elements, or every element of a set must be unique.
    Set is not an ordered collection

    HashSet class of java collctions framework provides the functionalities of the hash table data structure
    HashSet class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table
    HashSet methods - add(),addAll(),clone(),contains(),isEmpty(),size(),clear()
